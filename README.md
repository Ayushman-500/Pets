Pets App
===================================

This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs. I learned to build this app in a Udacity course ([Android Basics Nanodegree by Google: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845)). 

Learnt  how  to  persist  data  and  used  SQLite  database  to  do  so.   
Understood  the  working  of  content providers and loaded the data to the user interface with the help of cursor loader.
